# MD5-hash-cracker
This is my very first project being posted on github so I hope you enjoy it!

This is a hash cracker for the MD5 Hash format.

# How to use it
To use this properly and ensure everything is working as it should be, make sure to:
1. Only crack a single hash at a time (Don't add a space at the start nor a new line after the hash).
2. For wordlists, make sure to not add a space at the start nor any extra characters that aren't a part of the password afterwards (Supports multiple passwords at a time, seperate them with new lines and don't add spaces before nor after the passwords).

Anyways if you enjoy the project please makre sure to star it! :D
